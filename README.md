# ainsanity

I'm putting forward a motion to replace the terms **Artificial Intelligence** and **AI**, with **Automated Software System** and **ASS**.

Here is a cross-browser WebExtension which does exactly that on any webpage.

Basically, I was getting a bit tired of constantly reading "*XYZ use **an Artificial Intelligence** to do ABC*". It's paritcularly annoying when used as a noun, e.g. **The** Artificial Intelligence ..., **My** AI ..., **An** AI ..., etc.
